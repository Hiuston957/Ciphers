Text Encryption and Decryption Application Specification (Caesar Cipher)

Author: 14546
1. Introduction

The text encryption and decryption application is a simple tool that allows users to transform text using the Caesar cipher algorithm. The program enables users to input text, select an encryption or decryption key, and perform the corresponding operation on the text.
2. Application Features
2.1 Encryption

    Users can enter text to be encrypted in the "Normal text (input)" field.
    Users can select an encryption key from the dropdown list "Key."
    After choosing the key and clicking the "Run encryption" button, the text is encrypted using an algorithm similar to the Caesar cipher.
    The encrypted text is displayed in the "Ciphertext (output)" field.

2.2 Decryption

    Users can input the encrypted text in the "Ciphertext (output)" field for decryption.
    Users can select a decryption key from the dropdown list "Key."
    After choosing the key and clicking the "Run decryption" button, the encrypted text is decrypted and displayed in the "Normal text (input)" field.

2.3 Mode Switching

    Users can switch between encryption and decryption modes by toggling the "Encrypt" and "Decrypt" radio buttons.
    Changing the mode updates the labels of text fields and buttons accordingly.

2.4 Error Handling

    The application handles cases where the user does not provide text containing Polish letters during encryption. In such cases, those characters are ignored during encryption.
    Letter case is not significant for the program; all characters are converted to lowercase.
    The application handles cases where the user does not provide text or a key before attempting encryption or decryption. In such cases, the application displays an error message and does not proceed with the process.

3. User Interface

The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) with the following elements:

    "Normal text (input)" text field: For inputting text to be encrypted or decrypted.
    "Ciphertext (output)" text field: Displays the encrypted or decrypted text.
    Dropdown list "Key": Allows users to select an encryption or decryption key.
    "Run encryption" or "Run decryption" button: Initiates the encryption or decryption process based on the selected option.
    "Encrypt" and "Decrypt" radio buttons: Enables users to choose between encryption and decryption modes.
    Labels "Normal text (input)," "Ciphertext (output)," "Key," "Encrypt," and "Decrypt": Display descriptions for the respective fields and options.
